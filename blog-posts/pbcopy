<h1>Neo Vim is Overrated</h1>

	<p>As divisive as the title may be, I believe I come in at a compromise. Neovim has been, for all its worth, an adventure and a genuine joy. It is not faster than vscode or even intelliJ (okay maybe when IntelliJ is having a bad day), and it is not, without your own code, entirely customizable. However, for those seeking a barebones experience, devoid of annoyances that are not entirely your fault, I think Neovim is a contender for platform of choice.</p>

	<p>I came to Neovim suffocated. Suffocated by the overractive user interfaces offered by Idea (my company's tool of choice). I could boil down my workflow to a few basic keystrokes but was often assaulted with dropdown menus and multi-panel interfaces. Like a papercut, this irritated me every day, but I did nothing about it. Later I found Neovim.</p>

	<p>Out of the box, Neovim is quite plain. Given my motivations for switching, I found this to be a strength. With a few plugins, I was at about 80% productivity. (Note, I had been using vim motions for years at this point). My deficit was mostly due to us being a Java house, and me not having the patience to setup the language server.</p>

	<p>I think this strikes to the root of my "issues" with Neovim. Idea employes hundreds of people to keep IntelliJ and friends enterprise ready. While I do not need every tool IntelliJ offers, I do appreciate a few of them. In order to get these to work in my Neovim setup, I would need to spend a considerable amount of time on upkeep. There is nothing wrong with that, work for what you have. However, I believe it strikes to the root of why some people like Neovim and why others just cannot be bothered.</p>

	<p>Neovim is, by some of its supporters, overrated. It is not some lightning fast text editor, capable of lapping your current setup. It is not amazingly customizable; it is, without custom plugins, moderately customizable. Neovim is a strong candidate for hardest worker. It provides a platform for you to build your workspace. But "you" and "build" cannot be overstated, you must pay for all productivity gains you make.</p>

	<p>Neovim is good at allowing people to customize their workspace, but makes no reservations about how hard it may be to keep that workspace in the state it is in. For this reason, I feel Neovim is overrated. We rate it so highly because of the positives it introduces, but, I feel, we are often apologetic about the harsh realities of keeping that not-so-chad neovim setup up to date.</p>
