<h1>Neovim is Overrated</h1>

    <p>As divisive as the title may be, I believe I come in at a compromise. Neovim has been, for all it’s worth, an adventure and a genuine joy. It is not faster than VS Code or even IntelliJ (okay, maybe when IntelliJ is having a bad day), and it is not, without your own code, entirely customizable. However, for those seeking a bare-bones experience, devoid of annoyances that are not entirely your fault, I think Neovim is a contender for platform of choice.</p>

    <p>I came to Neovim suffocated. Suffocated by the overactive user interfaces offered by IntelliJ (my company’s tool of choice). I could boil down my workflow to a few basic keystrokes but was often assaulted with dropdown menus and multi-panel interfaces. Like a papercut, this irritated me every day, but I did nothing about it. Later, I found Neovim.</p>

    <p>Out of the box, Neovim is quite plain. Given my motivations for switching, I found this to be a strength. With a few plugins, I was at about 80% productivity (note: I had been using Vim motions for years at this point). My deficit was mostly due to us being a Java house and me not having the patience to set up the language server.</p>

    <p>I think this strikes at the root of my “issues” with Neovim. JetBrains employs hundreds of people to keep IntelliJ and its siblings enterprise-ready. While I do not need every tool IntelliJ offers, I do appreciate a few of them. In order to get these to work in my Neovim setup, I would need to spend a considerable amount of time on upkeep. There is nothing wrong with that—work for what you have. However, I believe this explains why some people like Neovim and why others just cannot be bothered.</p>

    <p>Neovim is, by some of its supporters, overrated. It is not some lightning-fast text editor capable of lapping your current setup. It is not amazingly customizable; without custom plugins, it is moderately customizable. Neovim is a strong contender for hardest worker. It provides a platform for you to build your workspace. But “you” and “build” cannot be overstated—you must pay for every productivity gain you make.</p>

    <p>Neovim is good at allowing people to customize their workspace, but makes no reservations about how hard it may be to keep that workspace in the state it is in. For this reason, I feel Neovim is overrated. We rate it so highly because of the positives it introduces, but I feel we are often apologetic about the harsh realities of keeping that not-so-chad Neovim setup up to date.</p>
